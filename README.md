Problem Statement: Stock Market Analysis and Prediction

Explanation: Our aim is to create software that analyses previous stock data of certain companies,
with help of certain parameters that affect stock value. We are going to implement these values in data mining algorithms.
This will also help us to determine the values that particular stock will have in near future.
We will determine the Month’s High and Low with help of data mining algorithms.
In this project we are going to take a five years of stock data for our analysis and prediction.
